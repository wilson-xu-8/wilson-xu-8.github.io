<h1>Hi, I'm Wilson</h1>
<h3>A Computer Science student at UC Berkeley</h3>
<h2><br>This is my past experience:</h2>
<h3>Software Engineer Intern at Five9</h3>
<h3>Software Engineer Intern at Intel</h3>
<p>
    Optimized device database management in FPGA design software platform with Python program by analyzing statistics of user designs, retrieving and processing millions of design properties from internal databases to improve data storage efficiency.<br>
    Wrote Python program to generate large-scale, multi-layer FPGA designs, supporting user-specified circuit parameters in JSON format, for simulation and performance testing of internal device databases.<br>
    Streamlined debugging process of logic design software compiler tool for external customers, by revising Makefiles of the compilation process while running regression tests to ensure compatibility with existing repository.
</p>
<h2><br>This are my past projects:</h2>
<h3>End-to-End Secured Filesystem</h3>
<p>
    Constructed file system in Golang with secure data sharing features across many concurrent users, each with multiple devices
    Upheld IND-CPA confidentiality and EU-CPA integrity requirements for file invitations, password management schemes, select file storage and appending functionality, etc.
</p>
<h3>Pintos Operating System</h3>
<p>
    Designed and implemented an operating system in C with a team.<br>
    Supported all fundamental operations such as process executions, forking, system calls, variable data sizes, priority scheduling, and memory management.<br>
</p>
<h3>Handwritten Digit Classification w/ Machine Learning</h3>
<p>
    Produced a handwritten digit classification neural network model that successfully classifies whether a digit from the MNIST dataset is a “3” or a “9” with 98% accuracy.<br>
    Developed back-propagation/gradient descent formula for this model from scratch, performing matrix computations with Numpy library and visualizing model progress with Matplotlib.
</p>
<h3>Caltask: Web Development Productivity Tool</h3>
<p>
    Created a workload and assignment manager with HTML/CSS and JS w/ team of three.<br>
    Added the ability to add, edit, and remove assignments from a task list. <br>
    Embedded Google Maps widgets to display directions towards common study areas.
</p>
<h3>Numc: Numpy Optimization</h3>
<p>
    Programmed a matrix calculator in C, supporting features such as adding, multiplying, and exponentiation functions, achieving speedups of up to 700x.
</p>
<h3>Gitlet: Version Control</h3>
<p>
    Designed and produced a version control system emulating Git, with Java.<br>
    Supported commands such as add, commit, merge, checkout with custom data storage classes and utilized data structures for efficient file tracking.
</p>
<h3>Bias Detection via Sentiment Analysis (Data Science Society)</h3>
<p>
    Analyzed real-world text data in a Python Jupyter Notebook in a team, published Medium article with results: tinyurl.com/k10iqmb6.<br>
    Integrated NLP libraries (NLTK, scikit-learn) to measure political bias in news articles.
